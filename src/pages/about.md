👋 I'm Sean, a software engineer.

I studied math in college, and began my career as an applied mathematician, working primarily in cryptography and machine learning. From there I began working in computer security, though I've always enjoyed "building" more than "breaking", which has led me to my current role as a software engineer.

I have expertise in Android and iOS internals, Linux systems, cryptography, and software quality processes. My work experience has ranged from federal agencies to startups, and high-stakes operational work to moonshot research initiatives.

If you like nerding out over terminal/CLI tools, internet privacy, or software best practices, you might enjoy my writings on this site.
